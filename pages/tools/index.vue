      <p>
        The Buy Write Options Calculator is a powerful tool designed to help investors evaluate the potential returns
        from a buy write strategy, also known as a covered call strategy. This strategy involves holding a long position
        in a stock, such as NVDA (NVIDIA), while simultaneously selling a call option on the same stock to generate
        additional income through the option premium. The calculator provides detailed metrics on the premium earned,
        potential profit, and return on investment (ROI) over both the short-term and long-term, making it easier for
        investors to assess the potential rewards and risks.
      </p>
      <p>Key metrics include:</p>
      <p><strong>Premium/Day and Premium/Year:</strong> This shows how much income is generated from the option premium
        on a daily and annualized basis.</p>
      <p><strong>Profit/Day and Profit/Year:</strong> The potential profit over different time periods.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Annualized ROI:</strong>Both the premium and profit return rates are displayed on an annualized basis
        to help you compare the potential investment returns with other strategies.
