      <h2>Stock Market Highlights for October 4, 2024</h2>

      <p>
        The Nasdaq Composite slipped slightly, down less than 0.1% to **17,918.48**, as investor sentiment was cautious ahead of upcoming job data. Several large tech stocks, including Amazon and Nvidia, experienced declines amid broader market volatility.
      </p>

      <p>Key stock movements for today:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Nvidia (NVDA)</strong>: Nvidia's stock fell by **1.2%**, driven by concerns over potential overheating in the AI market. While long-term demand for Nvidia’s AI chips remains strong, market caution was evident today, reflecting broader tech sector challenges.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Amazon (AMZN)</strong>: Amazon dropped by **0.8%**, despite solid growth in its cloud division, AWS. Investors remain wary of potential supply chain disruptions, which could impact Amazon's delivery and tech services.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adobe (ADBE)</strong>: Adobe rose **1.5%**, benefiting from positive reception to its newly launched AI-driven creative tools for enterprise clients. Investors are optimistic about Adobe's growth trajectory as it expands its Creative Cloud offerings.

      </ul>

      <p>External factors influencing the market:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Middle East Tensions</strong>: Rising geopolitical tensions between **Israel and Hamas** have pushed **Brent crude** oil prices up by **1.23%**, contributing to inflationary concerns. This has added pressure on the tech sector, which is sensitive to rising production costs and consumer sentiment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Supply Chain Disruptions</strong>: Strikes at key U.S. ports are delaying shipments of tech components. **Intel (INTC)** and other semiconductor companies are already reporting concerns about production slowdowns, which could impact earnings in upcoming quarters.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Federal Reserve Policy</strong>: Investors are closely monitoring the Federal Reserve’s next move, with expectations of a possible rate cut in **November**. Strong job data, combined with weaker wage growth, is leading to speculation about the potential easing of borrowing costs, which could provide relief to the tech sector.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        While **Adobe** performed well today, major tech names like **Nvidia** and **Amazon** experienced headwinds as market participants brace for further economic data releases and the impact of geopolitical events.
