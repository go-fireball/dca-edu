      <h2>Stock Market Highlights for October 9, 2024</h2>
      <p>On October 9, 2024, the U.S. stock market rallied, primarily driven by tech stocks and the easing of oil
        prices. The Nasdaq surged by 1.5%, with notable contributions from big tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and
        Amazon (AMZN), while the S&P 500 gained 1%. The drop in oil prices, as geopolitical tensions in the Middle East
        slightly cooled, alleviated investor concerns, allowing tech stocks to bounce back after a rough start to the
        week.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Tech Drivers:</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>NVIDIA (NVDA)</strong> continued its strong performance, benefiting from its AI-driven business
        momentum.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Amazon</strong> also saw a boost ahead of its Prime Day event, further lifting tech sentiment.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Large-Cap Gains and Losses</strong>Large-cap stocks saw mixed results. Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft
        (MSFT) had modest gains, contributing to the broader market's strength. However, Tesla (TSLA) faced volatility
        due to uncertainties around its deliveries and broader market conditions.
      </p>

      <h3>Upcoming Large-Cap Earnings:</h3>

      <p>The upcoming weeks will feature significant earnings reports from large-cap companies. Tesla (TSLA) is set to
        report earnings on October 18, and Microsoft and Amazon will report soon. These earnings are expected to
        significantly influence the market, especially as investors look for guidance on future growth in a
        high-interest-rate environment.
      </p>

      <h3>Fed Announcements:</h3>
      <p>No new major announcements from the Fed today, but investors are anticipating key inflation data later in the
        week. This data could influence the Fed's next move, especially if inflation trends higher than expected.
      </p>

      <p>With earnings season kicking off and inflation data on the horizon, the market is expected to remain volatile.
        Tech stocks will likely continue to drive the market's direction, with investors closely watching the earnings
        reports of big names like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon to gauge the impact of AI and consumer spending trends.
