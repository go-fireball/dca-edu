      <h2>What is Dollar-Cost Averaging?</h2>
      <p>
        Dollar-Cost Averaging, or DCA, is like buying your favorite snack in small portions over time, rather than
        spending all your money on it in one big purchase. You spread out your money, investing a little bit regularly,
        instead of trying to guess the best time to invest all at once.
      </p>

      <p>For example, imagine you have $100 to invest in stocks. Instead of using the $100 all at once, with DCA, you
        might invest $10 every week for 10 weeks. Sometimes, the stock price will be higher, and sometimes it will be
        lower, but over time, the average cost of your shares balances out.
      </p>
      <h2>Investing a Fixed Amount Over Time</h2>

      <p>With DCA, you invest the same amount of money at regular intervals—whether it's weekly, monthly, or quarterly.
        This approach takes the guesswork out of investing. You don't have to worry about whether the stock market is up
        or down on any given day. Instead, you focus on consistently adding to your investments.
      </p>
      <p>For example: Let's say you want to invest in a company's stock. You decide to invest $50 every month, no matter
        what the stock price is. Some months, the stock will cost more, and other months, it will cost less. Over time,
        you'll own more shares, and your average cost will balance out.
      </p>
      <h2>Benefits of DCA for Long-Term Investing</h2>

      <p>
        One of the biggest benefits of DCA is that it's a great strategy for long-term investors. Here's why:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>You Don't Have to Time the Market:</strong> No one can predict exactly when the stock market will go
          up or down. With DCA, you don't need to worry about trying to buy stocks at the perfect moment. You invest
          consistently, knowing that over time, the stock market tends to rise.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Building Good Habits:</strong>By investing regularly, you're creating a good habit of putting money
          aside for your future. It's like watering a plant regularly—you can't make it grow overnight, but with time
          and patience, it will grow tall and strong.
        </li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Smoothing Out Market Volatility</h2>
      <p>
        The stock market can be like a roller coaster—sometimes it goes up, and sometimes it goes down. DCA helps smooth
        out the ride. When the market is down, your fixed investment buys more shares because they're cheaper. When the
        market is up, your investment buys fewer shares because they're more expensive. Over time, this helps balance
        the ups and downs.
      </p>

      <p>For example: Let's say you're investing $50 each month in a stock. One month, the stock price is $10 per share,
        so your $50 buys 5 shares. The next month, the stock price drops to $5 per share, so your $50 buys 10 shares.
        The following month, the price goes back up to $10 per share, and you buy 5 shares again. Even though the stock
        price was volatile, you managed to buy more shares when the price was low, balancing out the overall cost of
        your investment.
      </p>
      <h2>How DCA Reduces Risk in Volatile Markets</h2>

      <p>Markets can be unpredictable, and it's hard to know when prices will rise or fall. DCA reduces your risk by
        spreading out your investments over time. Instead of risking all your money on one single purchase at the wrong
        time (when prices are high), you reduce the chance of buying only when the market is expensive.
      </p>

      <p>This strategy works especially well in volatile markets, where prices can swing wildly up and down. By buying
        consistently, you ensure that you're getting an average price over time, which reduces the risk of overpaying
        for your investments.
      </p>

      <h2>Buying More Shares When Prices Drop</h2>
      <p>
        One of the coolest things about DCA is that when stock prices drop, your fixed investment amount buys more
        shares. This can feel like getting a bigger bang for your buck!
      </p>

      <p>For example: If you invest $50 per month, and in one month, the stock price is $10, you'll buy 5 shares. But if
        the stock price drops to $5 the next month, you'll be able to buy 10 shares. When the price eventually goes back
        up, you'll own more shares, which means more potential growth in the long run.
      </p>

      <h2>Real-Life Examples of DCA in Action</h2>

      <p>Let's look at a real-life example. Imagine you want to invest $600 in a stock over six months. Instead of
        putting all $600 into the stock at once, you decide to use DCA and invest $100 every month.
      </p>

      <p>Here's how it might look:</p>
      <v-data-table
          :headers="headers"
          :items="items"
          class="elevation-1"
      ></v-data-table>

      <p>Over six months, you would have bought shares at different prices. In the end, you've bought a total of 67.7
        shares at an average cost of about $8.85 per share, even though the price varied between $6 and $12.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Set Up a DCA Plan for Your Portfolio</h2>
      <p>Setting up a DCA plan is simple. First, decide how much you want to invest regularly (weekly, monthly, or
        quarterly). Then, automate your investment so that the same amount of money is invested in your chosen stock or
        fund on a regular schedule.
      </p>
      <p>For example, you might decide to invest $100 per month in a stock index fund. You can set up automatic
        investments through your brokerage account, so the money is taken from your bank account and invested without
        you having to do anything.
      </p>

      <h2>Automating Your Investment Strategy</h2>
      <p>Automating your DCA strategy is like setting your alarm clock to wake you up every day—you don't have to think
        about it, it just happens. Many investment platforms allow you to automate your DCA plan, so your chosen amount
        is invested regularly, no matter what the stock price is.
      </p>
      <p>
        This makes it easier to stick to your plan and helps you avoid emotional decisions, like stopping your
        investments when the market is down or trying to invest too much when prices are high.
