      <h2>Stock Market Highlights for October 4, 2024</h2>

      <p>
        For today's large-cap market movers on the Nasdaq, several tech giants saw notable gains. Amazon (AMZN) surged
        by 2.50%, benefiting from the market's positive reaction to strong labor data. Similarly, Meta Platforms (META)
        was up 2.26% on improved sentiment and tech sector momentum. Other significant gainers include CrowdStrike
        (CRWD), which rose 2.99%, and Lululemon (LULU), up by 2.98%, both riding the wave of tech and retail recovery.
      </p>

      <p>On the downside, large-cap losers included TransDigm (TDG), which dropped by 4.48%, and Equifax (EFX), down by
        3.37%, as these companies faced pressure from concerns over rising interest rates and sector-specific
        challenges
      </p>


      <p>These movements reflect ongoing market volatility, influenced by factors like geopolitical tensions in the
        Middle East and interest rate uncertainties. Keep an eye on how these external forces continue to impact sectors
        differently in the coming days.
      </p>

      <p>Today's earnings news was relatively quiet in terms of major reports. Some noteworthy highlights include Apogee
        Enterprises (APOG), which reported earnings, but detailed financial results were not yet disclosed widely. In
        the week ahead, investors are anticipating major reports, such as PepsiCo on October 8, where analysts expect
        earnings per share (EPS) of $2.29 on revenue of $23.8 billion. Pepsi's results will likely focus on consumer
        demand trends, especially at Frito-Lay and Pepsi Beveragesâ€‹(
      </p>

      <p>Additionally, the earnings season will pick up pace next week with financial giants like JPMorgan Chase
        reporting on October 11, expected to post EPS of $4.01 on $41.7 billion in revenue. This could provide key
        insights into the financial sector's health
      </p>

      <p>No significant earnings surprises occurred today, but the upcoming financial disclosures should provide more
        clarity on various sectors' performance, particularly in consumer goods and banking.
      </p>

      <h2>The market outlook for the near term remains mixed, with several key factors influencing sentiment:</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Geopolitical Risks: </strong>The ongoing conflict between Israel and Iran has heightened tensions,
        leading to volatility
        in energy markets. Oil prices have surged nearly 10%, which could exacerbate inflationary pressures globally.
        The situation remains fluid, with potential impacts on global supply chains if the conflict escalates
      </p>

      <p><strong>Economic Data and Federal Reserve Policy:</strong> The U.S. jobs report for September exceeded
        expectations, with strong
        payroll gains and wage growth. While this indicates resilience in the labor market, it also raises concerns that
        the Federal Reserve may maintain a tighter monetary policy for longer than expected. Rising bond yields and
        interest rate volatility are contributing to uncertainty in the stock and bond markets
      </p>

      <p><strong>Earnings Season:</strong> As earnings season approaches, companies like PepsiCo and JPMorgan Chase will
        provide key
        insights into consumer demand and the health of the financial sector. Strong earnings could support market
        sentiment, but weaker-than-expected results could trigger sell-offs
      </p>

      <p><strong>Sector Performance:</strong> Energy stocks are likely to continue outperforming due to higher oil
        prices, while
        rate-sensitive sectors like real estate and utilities may face pressure from rising interest rates
      </p>

      <p>Overall, the outlook is cautious, with market participants closely watching geopolitical developments,
        inflation data, and upcoming corporate earnings reports to gauge the direction of the markets in the near term.
