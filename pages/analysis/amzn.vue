        Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) continues to be a giant in the global marketplace, boasting a massive market
        capitalization of $1,957.53 billion, reinforcing its dominant position as one of the largest companies
        worldwide. With a P/E ratio of 44.41, Amazon trades at a premium compared to the broader market, signaling
        strong investor confidence in its future growth despite a higher price-to-earnings ratio.

      <p>
        Amazon's return on equity (ROE) stands at a solid 21.93%, reflecting its efficiency in generating profit from
        shareholder investments. However, its debt-to-equity ratio is notably high at 66.76, suggesting that Amazon has
        a substantial amount of debt relative to its equity, although its current ratio of 1.096 indicates the company
        has sufficient short-term assets to cover its liabilities.

        Amazon’s operational metrics highlight its profitability, with an operating margin of 9.92% and an EBITDA margin
        of 17.22%. The company also has robust free cash flow of $59.19 billion, underscoring its ability to generate
        cash from its operations, which can be reinvested into growth initiatives or returned to shareholders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amazon is showing impressive earnings growth of 93.8%, driven by its continuous innovation and expansion into
        new sectors. While revenue growth is more moderate at 10.1%, the company remains on a stable growth trajectory.
        Its price-to-book ratio of 8.27 reflects a premium valuation compared to its assets.
      </p>

      <p>
        Institutional investors hold a dominant 64.1% of Amazon’s shares, indicating strong backing from large financial
        institutions and overall market confidence in the company’s long-term prospects.
