        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>External Factors Affecting Markets:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Oil Prices and Middle East Tensions</strong>: Rising oil prices, driven by geopolitical tensions in
          the Middle East, particularly conflicts in Israel and surrounding regions, have injected uncertainty into
          global markets. Brent crude prices rose by 1.23%, signaling potential inflationary pressures ahead.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Global Supply Chain Concerns</strong>: Ongoing disruptions due to labor strikes at U.S. ports and
          potential hurricanes affecting supply routes have cast a shadow over tech production, particularly for
          companies like Nvidia and Apple that rely on intricate supply chains.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Federal Reserve Policy</strong>: Investors are increasingly betting on interest rate cuts in November,
          especially after today’s jobs report showed stronger-than-expected job gains but cooling wage growth. While
          the potential rate cuts are viewed positively by tech investors, there remains concern about the broader
          economic outlook.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As the tech sector continues to be shaped by AI developments, supply chain risks, and external events, investor
        sentiment remains cautious but optimistic, with many seeing tech stocks as resilient in the face of global
        challenges.
